# hello-world
... a place for testing out new things ...
This repository is just a place where I test out things I haven't tried before related to github. 
I initially created it following the github tutorial https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/.
This website (http://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners) will also be useful, but that is future work.
